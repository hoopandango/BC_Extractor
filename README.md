## **Overview**

* **extras** contains data files that are mostly human-maintained. These cannot be automated.
* **latest_en** and **latest_jp** contain data extracted from the latest version of Battle Cats. I am not adding them to this repo for both size and legality reasons. You only need resLocal and DataLocal folders from these, though.
* **out_intermediates** contain intermediates that need some human intervention mid-processing.
* **reusables** contain .tsv and .json format files, most of which are reused by some other program.
* **outputs** contains .db files or files that are not going to be reused by other programs.
* **tests** has test cases. I don't know how to do unit testing so I mostly plug them manually.
* **_config.json** and **_schemas.json** are configuration files. I don't know if it's good design to have them that way, but it sounds edgy so I did it.

The rest should hopefully have self-explanatory titles.
